"""The background-task queue dashboard, mounted inside the Django admin.

Shows live broker state: per-queue backlog and throughput, what the worker is
holding, delayed messages, and the dead-letter queue, with requeue/purge
actions. Same arrangement as suitenumerique/messages.

The dashboard ships with the Streams broker as a WSGI app, so this module
adapts it to Django and, more importantly, puts it behind the admin's own
access control. It exposes destructive endpoints (flush a queue, purge a DLQ)
and renders task payloads, and performs no authentication of its own. Mounted
under the admin URL, it also sits behind the admin IP allowlist of the Caddy
proxy (DEPLOYCENTER_ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST, see docs/deployment.md).
